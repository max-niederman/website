## Rationale

Although the title of the market suggests that
any delay of the sentencing triggers a "Yes" resolution,
the actual rules read thus:

> This market will resolve to "Yes" if Donald Trump's sentencing in "The State of New York vs. Donald Trump" is rescheduled to a date after November 26, 2024 ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to "No".

This criterion is technically not satisfied by
an indefinite postponement of the sentencing,
which I believe is the most likely outcome.

Additionally, a clarification to the rules explicitly states that

> Per the rules, the sentencing must be delayed to a further date for this market to resolve to "Yes". If all charges are dropped before any delay in sentencing is announced, this market will resolve to "No".

It also seems somewhat likely (~10%) to me that the prosecutors will simply drop the case,
so buying no shares at 5 or 6 cents on the dollar seems very good.

## Execution

I purchased 200 shares at an average price of 5.6¢, for around $11,
with a sell limit order at 92¢ and no stop loss,
because Polymarket doesn't support them natively.

In the future I will probably make a bot that can do stop loss orders for me.

## Retrospection

The day after entry,
[Trump's sentencing was postponed indefinitely](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/nyregion/trump-sentencing-postponed.html).
A few hours later, and before I woke up, the market was resolved to "Yes" with no disputes,
despite the "Yes" criterion being technically unfulfilled.

Although I lost my entire position,
I don't think this trade was actually a bad one.
The problem is just that I assumed the rules would be followed to the letter,
and it seems that's not the case on Polymarket.
If I had had a significant position, I would perhaps
try to dispute this either by posting a dispute bond or (maybe?) filing a small claims case against UMA?

However, in the future I will probably just stay away from rules-lawyering arguments like these,
unless I can get an actual clarification in my favor after entering the position.

The only other thing is that I wasn't aware that
[prosecutors had already declined to drop the case](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/nyregion/trump-bragg-manhattan-case.html)
by the time I entered,
making the true likelihood of the case being dropped before being delayed much, much lower.
In the future I need to do more thorough research before betting.
