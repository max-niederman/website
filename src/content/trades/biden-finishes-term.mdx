## Rationale

Just a couple months before the end of Biden's term, Polymarket priced "Yes" shares on this market at just 92¢.
This immediately struck me as an insanely low price.

And indeed, doing some quick math,
the probability of Biden finishing his term would have to be lower than 91.6%
to (risk-indifferently) match the risk-free rate of ~4.4% at the time.
**At a more reasonable forecast of 99% that Biden finishes his term,
the expected return is a staggering 71.5% per annum return.**

As far as I can tell this is just a case of Polymarket being extremely inefficient.
Perhaps all the Trumpers are convinced Biden will resign to make Kamala president
or something similarly ridiculous.

## Execution

I purchased 20 shares at an average price of 91.6¢, for a total of $18.28 before gas fees.
I think my entry was fine although I probably could have stood to
spend some more time and effort on my bet sizing.
This was an extremely good price which I mostly didn't take advantage of,
and in the future I should at least spend some time estimating what the [Kelly bet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) would be.[^kelly_bet]
On the other hand, I don't want to go overboard and end up essentially just gambling.

[^kelly_bet]: In this case, the 99% forecast earlier results in a Kelly bet of just under 89% of the available bankroll.
I would of course not be this confident given my surprise at the price in the first place.

My exit was similarly not great.
I set a sell limit order for half my shares at 98¢,
but on reflection I realize that there was no principled reason for this:
I just wanted to lock in some profit to avoid the
emotional risk of failure by "losing my whole Polymarket portfolio on a dumb bet,"
but rationally speaking this trade was such a small fraction of my portfolio that
I should have been almost entirely risk-indifferent and therefore just held.

## Retrospect

Overall I think this was a very good trade.
As I mentioned, I definitely could have done better on my execution and bet sizing
so I ultimately made a negligible amount of money,
but as with most trades I post here,
my primary goal here is to learn and improve my process,
which I think I did.

Of course, there is also the question of how predictive trades like these are
of future success in trades with much more money on the line.

It's also surprising to me just how underpriced this contract was.
This very much feels to me like a case of Polymarket users being irrational,
but its also possible I'm just missing something and got lucky.
I'll definitely be on the lookout for more opportunities like this in the future.
