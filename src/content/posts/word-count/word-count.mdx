One of the most common forms of schoolwork
is the writing assignment.
The idea is that,
if a student understands the subject,
they should be able to
demonstrate that by writing about the subject.
These kinds of assignments
are widely considered to
improve comprehension and writing skill
in addition to measuring comprehension.

However, there is a huge problem with this approach:
writing assignments involve writing
for an audience which already understands the concepts being discussed.
The goal is not
to communicate an idea,
but rather to prove that the author already grasps that idea.

Needless to say,
this is _not at all_
the goal when writing outside of school.
Outside of school,
the goal is nearly always to
communicate an idea the audience is new to.

One of the most important
ways this distinction appears
is verbosity.
In school,
using many, fancy words
signals to the teacher
that you understand the material.
Students who expend the effort to
understand the material well
are also more likely to
spend time writing many words.

But crucially,
correlation does not necessarily imply causation:
the willingness to write a thousand words on a topic
is not _caused_ by understanding of that topic,
only correlated with it.
The idea that
someone must understand a topic well to write at length on it
is entirely wrong.
In fact,
the ability to
communicate an idea succinctly
is one of the strongest
marks of understanding.

Grading on word count
entirely misses the point:
it only encourages students to
add meaningless padding.
This makes students worse writers,
and it doesn't even measure understanding well.
