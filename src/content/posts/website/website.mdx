This is the second major redesign of my personal website,
and I took inspiration from a lot of places for the design

I wanted to replicate [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net)'s features for effectively comunicating lots of information in a web format, like

- sidenotes falling back to popups on mobile as opposed to footnotes,
- indicators and popups on links for Wikipedia, GitHub, LessWrong, etc.,
- dynamic progress indicators while reading,
- as well as just generally good design decisions.

I also really love the work of Edward Tufte and took a lot of inspiration
from his books and web implementations like [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).[^1]

Besides sidenotes, the biggest thing I've copied from Tufte are full-width figures
extending past the relatively small width of the body text.

<img
	src={cliffordAttractorFigure.src}
	alt="A picture of a Clifford attractor like the one on the landing page"
	class="fullwidth"
/>

[^1]: [Micah Lerner's blog](https://www.micahlerner.com/) is a good example of a site using Tufte CSS.
