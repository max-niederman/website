["The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas"](/archive/omelas) is a short story by Ursula K. Le Guin
which I believe most people misinterpret.
If you have not read it recently, you should reread it
-- it is fewer than three thousand words long.

## Utilitarianism

``Omelas'' is usually read as a critique of utilitarianism.
In a utilitarian ethical framework, the suffering of the child is more than justified by the great joy of the rest of Omelas.
And yet, people still walk away from Omelas.
In this interpretation, the ones who walk away are rejecting the utilitarian ethic which allows for the suffering of the child.

At first glance, this seems like a reasonable interpretation of the story.
However, I believe it fails to explain two major parts of the story:
the diegetic necessity of the child's suffering,
and the emphasis on the unbelievability of the perfect Omelas, before the introduction of the child.

## ``Do you believe?''

Almost two thirds of the text is spent simply describing the city of Omelas without the child.
The narrator gives more and more detail, insisting that there is no dark side to Omelas.
The text implores the reader to believe in the perfect city,
even inviting them to imagine their own version of utopia:

> But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could convince you. Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion, for certainly I cannot suit you all.

When you read the story, though, you are not convinced.
Throughout the description of Omelas, you are always waiting for the darkness behind the utopia to be revealed.
Without any evil, the story of Omelas is not believable, not interesting, not meaningful.

> The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain. If you can’t lick ‘em, join ‘em. If it hurts, repeat it. But to praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose hold of everything else. We have almost lost hold; we can no longer describe happy man, nor make any celebration of joy.

## The Child

> Do you believe? Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy? No? Then let me describe one more thing.

Only after the reader rejects the perfection of Omelas
does the narrator describe the child.
Afterwards, it is easy to accept the tale of Omelas.
With the introduction of suffering,
the shallow tale of utopia becomes a sophisticated parable on utilitarianism.

This shallowness of perfection is also the diegetic reason that Omelas cannot exist without the child.
The child's suffering is what gives the joy of Omelas' inhabitants its meaning, and they know this:

> Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their generosity and the acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives. Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible happiness. They know that they, like the child, are not free. They know compassion. **It is the existence of the child, and their knowledge of its existence, that makes possible the nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the profundity of their science.**

The child exists to make Omelas *easier* for the reader and its inhabitants to accept, not harder.

## The Ones Who Walk Away

## Towards Utopia

- People can't accept utopia
  - People find happy stories unsatisfying
  - Can't believe that utopia is possible
- They find it easier to believe utopia if there is some price
  - Most people fall into this camp ("most of us" in ending, and all of Omelas)
- The ones who walk away have nowhere to go
